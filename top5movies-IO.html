        <h2>Inside Out</h2>
            <p>A 2015 American 3D computer-animated buddy fantasy comedy-drama adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The film is set in the mind of a young girl named Riley Andersen (Kaitlyn Dias), where five personified emotions—Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Anger (Lewis Black), Fear (Bill Hader), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling)—try to lead her through life as her parents (Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan) move from Minnesota to San Francisco and she has to adjust to her new surroundings.After premiering at the 68th Cannes Film Festival in May, Inside Out was released in North America on June 19, 2015, accompanied by the short film Lava directed by James Ford Murphy. Critics praised the film's concept, screenplay, subject matter, musical score, and the vocal performances—particularly for Poehler, Smith, and Richard Kind. The film grossed $90.4 million in its first weekend—the highest opening for an original title at the time. It accumulated over $857 million in worldwide box office revenue. Inside Out has received several awards, including a BAFTA Award, Golden Globe Award, Critics' Choice Award, Annie Award, Satellite Award, and Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. In 2016, the film was named as the 41st best film of the 21st century from a poll of 177 film critics from around the world.</p>
